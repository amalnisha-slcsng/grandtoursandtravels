            One of the main attractions in Kerala is the houseboat cruises on the backwaters, particularly in Alappuzha and Kumarakom. These houseboats, traditionally known as "kettuvallams," offer a luxurious way to experience the scenic beauty and serenity of the region. The cruises provide a glimpse into the local life and lush landscapes of Kerala.
